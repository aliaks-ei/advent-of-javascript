# Computer keyboard

This project contains a computer keyboard simulator that consists of the following steps:

- user sees the computer keyboard centered on the page;
- a random letter starts to jiggle;
- user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop;
- a new, random key starts to jiggle.
