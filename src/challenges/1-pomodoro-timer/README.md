# Pomodoro timer

This project contains a Pomodoro timer that works the following way:

- the timer starts by clicking on the **"Start"** button;
- once the user clicks start, the word **"Start"** will change to **"Stop"**. Then, the user can click on the **"Stop"** button to make the timer stop;
- click on the gear icon allows to setup the duration (minutes and seconds) of the timer;
- once the timer finishes, the ring changes from green to red and an alert message is passed to the browser.
